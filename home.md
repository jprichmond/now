## Hello There

You have reached the personal page of yours truly, Jason Richmond. It’s currently under construction if writing about oneself can be considered constructive.

In the meantime, take a look at my code [resumé](resume.html)


And for something more fun — play around with these:

* [Awesome’s Meet ’n’ Eat](https://editor.p5js.org/counternote/sketches/QFJWkwokI): A game about consumption in p5.js created as the final part of an about 25,000-word tutorial on Javascript for kids ages 10–18 while working for South Bend Code School. The code was written using some of that newish ES6 sugar to make it resemble the C-clones and Java proper (along with the ignoring the the strict equality operator '==='). All the graphics including the faces are written in code — not a .gif or a .png in sight.
  
* [Faces Collide](https://editor.p5js.org/counternote/sketches/sTdxjpT5k): A simple implementation of collisions in p5.js created during a research phase of the Javascript tutorial. The logic was ripped from a math paper on linear algebra.
  
* [Moon Phases](https://editor.p5js.org/counternote/sketches/cz1dAjMmn): A exploration in bezier curves within p5.js to create crescents and eyes turned into the phases of the moon. The logic here came from learning about magic number kappa (not even Kappa).
